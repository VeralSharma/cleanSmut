---

## Overview
CleanSmut is a powerful script designed to help users scan directories for images and videos, detecting potentially NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content using the OpenNSFW2 library. This tool is particularly useful for those dealing with a large amount of digital content, such as administrators of image-based websites or content managers. By automatically identifying and moving flagged files to a separate folder, CleanSmut streamlines the process of organizing and managing NSFW data.
